The typings for Ammo.js were taken from [giniedp/ammojs-typed](https://github.com/giniedp/ammojs-typed).

All credits to him, the dude has done a service to the community, and contributed to this project
through his work whether he knew it or not.

I strongly reccommend this library; the only reason _I DON'T_ use it is because this project
has a few modifications to the Ammmo.js code, and modifying `node_modules` becomes finicky.
